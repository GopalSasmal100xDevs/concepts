## What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes a wide range of inappropriate behaviors, such as:

- Making sexual comments, jokes, or gestures.
- Sharing explicit content without consent.
- Staring or leering in a sexual manner.
- Unwanted physical contact or advances.
- Sending sexually suggestive messages or emails.
- Displaying offensive or sexually suggestive materials.
- Making inappropriate remarks about someone's appearance or body.

Any behavior that makes someone feel uncomfortable, intimidated, or violated due to their gender or sexual orientation can be considered sexual harassment.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

If I face or witness sexual harassment, I should:

1. Document the incident: Keep a record of the behavior, including dates, times, locations, and any witnesses.
2. Speak up (if safe): If I feel comfortable to address the behavior directly with the person involved, telling them to stop.
3. Report the behavior: I will inform HR or a manager about the incident. Most workplaces have procedures in place to handle such complaints confidentially and appropriately.
4. Seek support: I will reach out to trusted colleagues, friends, or professional counselors if needed.
5. Follow up: I will ensure that the issue is being addressed and resolved by the relevant authorities.
6. Escalate if necessary: If the response is inadequate I will escalate the matter to higher management or external authorities like labor boards or legal professionals.
