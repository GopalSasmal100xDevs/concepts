The most interesting idea was how the brain uses both focused and diffused thinking to solve problems. Relaxing can actually help me learn better.

Focused mode is when I concentrate hard on a task. Diffused mode is when my brain is relaxed, letting new ideas come together. Both are important for learning.

## 4. what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?

**Steps to take when approaching a new topic:**

1. Break the topic down into smaller, manageable parts.
2. Focus on learning the most important concepts first.
3. Practice and apply the new knowledge regularly.
4. Continuously adjust and refine your approach based on feedback and experience.

## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

Some actions I can take to improve my learning process:

- **Switching between focused and diffused thinking**: I'll focus on a task, then take breaks to let my mind relax and form new ideas.
- **Using the Pomodoro Technique**: I’ll work in short, focused bursts followed by brief breaks to avoid burnout.
- **Practicing regularly**: Repetition will help reinforce what I learn and commit it to long-term memory.
- **Chunk information**: I’ll break complex topics into smaller, manageable pieces for easier understanding.
- **Avoiding procrastination**: I'll set small, achievable goals to stay consistent with my learning.
