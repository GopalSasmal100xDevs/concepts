# Tiny Habits

## Q1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea for me in BJ Fogg's video was his _tiny habits_ approach, like writing just one sentence a day if you're trying to build a journaling habit. This shows how starting small helps reduce the friction of getting started, and over time, these tiny actions grow into consistent routines.

## Q2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

### Using B = MAP to Make New Habits Easier

I can use BJ Fogg's **B = MAP** model to make new habits easier by focusing on the three components:

**B** (Behavior) = **M** (Motivation) + **A** (Ability) + **P** (Prompt)

Behavior happens when these three factors align at the same time.

### Components:

1. **M (Motivation)**: This represents my desire to perform the behavior. Motivation can fluctuate, but by keeping the habit small, I reduce the need for high motivation.
2. **A (Ability)**: This refers to how easy or hard it is to perform the behavior. By making the behavior simpler (e.g., flossing one tooth), I increase the chance of success.

3. **P (Prompt)**: A prompt is a trigger or reminder to perform the behavior. It could be something external, like an alarm, or tied to an existing routine, like brushing my teeth.

### Example:

To start an exercise habit, I could:

- **Motivation**: Keep the desire alive with small wins.
- **Ability**: Start with a very easy task like one pushup.
- **Prompt**: Lay out workout clothes as a visual cue.

By combining motivation, ability, and a clear prompt, I can make forming new habits easier and more sustainable.

## Q3: Why it is important to _Shine_ or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

### Importance of _Shine_ or Celebration After Each Habit

Celebrating after each successful completion of a habit is crucial because it reinforces the positive emotions associated with the behavior, making it more likely to become a habit. Here's why:

- **Emotional Reward**: When I celebrate, I attach a positive feeling to the behavior, creating an emotional reward.
- **Strengthening Neural Pathways**: Celebration strengthens the neural connections that help form the habit, making it easier for my brain to remember and repeat the action.
- **Positive Reinforcement**: The more I celebrate, the more I train my brain to crave repeating the behavior, turning it into a consistent habit.

#### Key Concept:

Whatever I celebrate becomes a habit. By celebrating small wins, I make the habit formation process more enjoyable and effective.

## Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea for me in this video was the concept of **"identity-based habits."** It emphasizes the importance of focusing on who you want to become, rather than what you want to achieve. This shift in mindset encourages building habits that align with your desired identity, making them more sustainable over time.

## Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book "Atomic Habits" suggests that the most effective way to build lasting habits is through **identity transformation**. Instead of setting goals like "I want to run a marathon," focus on becoming the type of person who runs regularly. By embodying the identity of the person you aspire to be, habits naturally follow.

## Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

The book advocates for reducing friction to make habits easier to do. This includes strategies like the **Two-Minute Rule**, where you scale down a new habit to its simplest form (e.g., reading one page). By removing barriers, you're more likely to stick with the habit consistently.

## Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

To make a bad habit harder to do, **increase the friction**. The book suggests making undesirable actions more difficult by adding more steps. For example, to reduce screen time, place your phone in another room, increasing the effort required to use it.

## Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and/or response satisfying?

I would like to exercise more. To make the cue obvious, I could lay out my workout clothes the night before. I can make it more attractive by choosing exercises I enjoy, and easier by starting with just 5 minutes a day. Celebrating with a small reward, like a refreshing smoothie, can make the response more satisfying.

## Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I would like to reduce my time spent on social media. To make the cue invisible, I can delete the app from my phone. I can make the process harder by logging out after each use, and make the response unsatisfying by tracking wasted time and using that as motivation to spend time more productively.
